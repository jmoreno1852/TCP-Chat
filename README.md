# TCP Chat Server
This project is a simple TCP-based chat server implemented in Python. It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and communicate in real-time. The system uses sockets for network communication and threads to handle multiple clients concurrently.

## Features

Supports multiple clients simultaneously.

Requests a nickname from clients upon connection for identification.

Broadcasts messages from one client to all other connected clients.

Basic exception handling for disconnections and network errors.

## How to Use

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmoreno1852/TCP-Chat/
cd TCP-Server/
```
2. Run the Server

Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.8 or higher), then start the server:
```bash
python main.py
```
The server will start and listen for incoming connections on port 4444 by default.

3. Run a Client

Open multiple terminals and run:
```bash
python client.py
```
Enter a nickname when prompted and start chatting. Messages will be visible to all connected clients.
